# Web Components

## What are they

- html elements defined by the dev
- used to create a user friendly experience
- work as an addition to the html 5 standards.

- consist of a combination of html, css and (mainly) javascript.

## How do they work

they combine multiple principles and technologies, that combined create a web-component.

## the three principles

different technogies that partly existed for a years now but never before were so easily utilised to create something bigger then themselves.

UNTIL NOW

(or better: nearly a year ago.)

<!--@TODO-->

we gonna take a look at the three underlining technologies as individual ideas:

- Custom Elements
- Shadow DOM
- HTML templates

--> all following the [HTML Living Standard specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements)

- outdated: HTML Modules
